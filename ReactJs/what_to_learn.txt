--------Story of React-----------------

facebook ko ek problem najar aai ki real time mein wo notification and reactions ko show nahi kar paa rahe hai unhe reactions notification and other data deliver karne mein page reload karna pad raha hai and wo isliye kyunki they were using something called php ab is problem se nipatne ke liye 2013 mein ek facebook ke engineer ne ek library banai ye library khaas thi kyunki ye data ko real time mein dikha paa rahi thi par is librayar ka kaam karne ka tareeka thoda different tha.


This reaload happens because browser ka nature hota hai jab bhi page mein kuch change hua to poora DOM tree refresh kara deta hai.jiske wajah se poora page re render hoga. jo ki kaafi inefficient hai matlab ki socho agar ek change par DOM ek baar refresh ho raha hai to 1lakh change pe 1lakh baar refresh hoga iske wajah se browser crash ho sakta hai. 

As we said earlier react ka kaam karne ka tarika thoda different hai so react js kabhi main DOM tree ko update nahi karti hai directly matlab ki agar page mein kuch bhi change hua to directly main DOM tree update nahi hoga is library ka khudka ek DOM tree hai uska naam hai Virtual DOM ye DOM tree exact copy hai real DOM tree ka. bas ek difference hai wo hai ki jab bhi Virtual DOM mein kuch change hoga to sirf use change kiya jayega jo ki change hua hai naa ki poore tree ko refresh kiya jayega.

Thats Why react become so famous and usefull for big Application.

------Advantage of React---------
1. Very Very less page reload
2. extreme use reusable components
3. it has many opportunities


react learning had 2 parts->
1.react js se code karna 
2.react js ka interview crack karna

-------react learn what matters-------

what - js library to maintain the front end efficiently

why - efficient and lightweight

how - create components and make data if you need it, link the data and change data whenevr you want, react will react jab bhi data change hoaga 

when - jab aapko ek thoda bade level par app create karna ho jisme khoob saari chezien ho rahi hai and khoob saara reusable components structure hai.


KUCHHHH KAAMMM KARLO
------------------------------------------

code karne ki jagah banana -Vscode
code chalande ki jagah banana -chrome
default code lekar ana
react coding mein saar code khud se nahi likhna padta hai react walo ne aapko ek tool diya hai uska naam hai create-react-app but we will not use it now cause usme kabhi kabhi kuch problem hai cause it has next js included in it thats why
so we will be using vite from vite we will get react raw app which has nextjs involved in it and also it take too much time some times it is utility vite is also a utility.

1. vite install KARLO
2. vite se naya app banao


use this command-
npm create vite@latest

ye command srif tab chalega jab node and npm installed hoga

code chalana 
output dikhana
code ke folder structure ko smajhna 

aap components banate ho aur ye saare components jaate hai ek parent components par aur parent components ko body mein put kar diya jaata hai
styling karna react mein-module Css, tailwindcss

components ek function hai jo ki return karega jsx
jsx html ki tarah dikhne wala syntax but uske paas kuch superpower hai jo html ke paas nahi hai

<h1>2+2</h1> in html we know the output will be 2+2 visible
but in jsx we can write it like this-
<h1>{2+2}</h1> and the output will be 4 visible

components
components banana
 
whenever you make components or function make sure you are making its start with capital alphabet and if we are making it in vite we have to use jsx and in vite their is script tag in index.html and in create react app their is already react script is running in it that includes main.js.


components jodna 
components mein reaction of data change smajhna 

react will react when state changes to state ka sahi se use karna hai like hume agar 12 h1 ka lana tha to pehle hum aise karte they <h1>12</h1>
but now we use state and data state se ata hai like this <h1>{state}</h1>

react ka naam react isliye hai kyunki wo react karta hai jab bhi state change hoti hai, aur yahi main model hai poore react ka yahi uska heart hai aur yahi uske kaam karne ka tareeka hai.

components mein data bhejna and receive karna 
components mein khud ka data banana
components mein bane huye data ko update karna


jsx is very similar to html with superpowers
React js

when we install node their is one package also install with that is called npm-node package manager and other is npx that means node package executer


Ui Updation is completely taken care by react

their are many hooks are available usememo, UseState, UseCallback and many more.


Virtual DOM, Fibre and reconciliation :

1.The createRoot create's its own DOM and then compare it with the web browser's DOM and only update those components which are actually updated.

2.But the browser removes the whole DOM and then recrates the whole DOM with the updated values this is called reload.

3. However virtual DOM tracks whole DOM like a tree like structure and updates only those values which were only changed.

4. But some values depends on network call so if we update a value it might get update immediately via a network call.

5. So we will have to update it again. To avoid this overhead we can drop the updation calls for the immediate value update.

6. The current algo used by the React is called the React Fibre algo.

7. The algo react uses to differentiate the web browser's tree and React's tree formed through create root is called reconciliation.

8. Reconciliation is the algo behind what popularly known as the Virtual-DOM.

9.In UI it is not necessary for every update to be applied immediately.

#onclick

- The on click method in React expects a function reference

- You can't directly pass parameters inside the function, instead, you need to pass it as a reference or 
  use arrow function syntax

- Refresh karne pe olive is lie aa rah a kio ke usestate ki defualt value di ha humne

- To update the state we need to use the setState method

- setState method takes a callback function as an argument

- Inside the callback function we can update the state

React will React when state changes
-------------------------------
Advance js topics for React-
1.ES5 VS ES6
2.ARRAY, OBJECTS, FUNCTIONS
3.ARROW FUNCTIONS / NORMAL FUNCTIONS
4.ARRAY METHODS (MAP,FILTER,REDUCE,FIND,FINDINDEX)
5.DESTUCTURING
6.REST SPREAD
7.TRY CATCH
8.ASYNC AWAIT
9.PROMISES

STARTING WITH REACT.js
--------------------------------
0. INSTALL NODE.js
1. create-next-app (React folder description)
2. UseState Hook (Varible of react) and Real DOM and Virtual DOM
3. calling function in react(Function)
4. Two way binding 
5. adding normal/module CSS in react and useRed (for validation, DOM properties)
6. toDo app
7. Breaking the components (importance of components)
8. props (normal data, children)
9. Introduction to class components (via lifecycle method) *not imp
10. useEffect lifecycle Hook
11. implimenting ajax in react (fetch/axios)
12. gallery app usering lorem pixum api (react pagination)
13. routing
14. showing flash message (react toastify)
15. context api(higher order components {HOC}, higher order function)
16. Cashbook app
