Redux toolkit:-
Humare data ko centralised karke har component tak pahuchane ka ek approach hai.
Redux ek individual entity hai jissey hum log javascript ke kisi v library ke sath use kar skte hai it can be react js or angular js or vanila js aur grx ke sath v rehta hai.


--it is similar to context api but difference ye hai ki jab application bahut large ho to hum log iska use karte hai.like context v iske jagah use ho skta hai waise jagah pe but that will not as efficient as this.

--useselector() Hook is used for sending data from centralised store data to any component application. any component can only read it not be able to change it.

--Action we use action to change any thing. iske help se kisi v reducer ke chote se part ko change kar skte hai.
  they are like normal function that we can call.

--dispatch is used to call action

--reducer isme chote chote data hote hai

The cycle is like this:-

Reducer to store to application component to action to reducer

--reducer se store mein data store hua 
--store se application component ko access mila
--application component mein koi change action se hoga
--action mein jo change kiya gaya hai woh reducer mein ayega 
--reducer will change and store in store.
